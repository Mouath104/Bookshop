# Bookshop-v2.3
It's a responsive web app that offers a list of Books to Buy.

There is two possible way of users: 
either a **Custoemr** user, or a **Power** user.

A **Customer** user can buy the offered books, while the **Power** user is the user that Manages the site, like Adding New Books, Editing or Deleting them.

I used Django Framework as Backend, And used HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and JS as the Frontend side.
